    <h1>Git-walkthrough-add (git-wt-add)</h1>

    <p> Git-wt-add is a darcs-style interactive staging
    script for git. It walks you through unstaged changes on a
    hunk-by-hunk basis and allows you to pick the ones you'd like
    staged. It features colorized diff output and a full set of
    navigation and dispatch commands. </p>

    <p> Git-wt-add is based on <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/41033">git-hunk-commit</a>
    --darcs, which was very close to what I wanted, but wasn't quite
    it. In general git-wt-add makes no attempt to conform to the
    real darcs interface, but it's probably pretty close. </p>

    <p> Git-wt-add is written in around 200 lines of Ruby. </p>
