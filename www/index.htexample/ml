    <h1>Git-walkthrough-commit</h1>

    <p> Git-walkthrough-commit is a darcs-style interactive commit
    script for git. It walks you through unstaged changes on a
    hunk-by-hunk basis and allows you to pick the ones you'd like
    staged. It features colorized diff output and a full set of
    navigation and dispatch commands. </p>

    <p> Git-walkthrough-commit is based on <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/41033">git-hunk-commit</a>
    --darcs, which was very close to what I wanted, but wasn't quite
    it.  </p>

    <p> Git-walkthrough-commit is written in less than 200 lines of Ruby. </p>
