    <h1>William's random git tools</h1>

    <p> Here are a bunch of random git-related tools I've found useful at some
    point and wanted to share. The git repository for all of these is cloneable
    at <code>git://repo.or.cz/git-walkthrough-commit.git</code>, and you can
    also <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/git-walkthrough-commit.git">browse it
    here</a>. </p>

    <h2>Git-show-merges</h2>

    <p> Git-show-merges is a simple tool for people with lots of topic
    branches. It shows you which branches have been merged in to the current
    branch, and which haven't. That's it. You can also specify multiple
    non-topic branches (merge branches?) on the commanline.</p>

    <p> You can download the script <a href="git-show-merges">here</a>. <p>

    <h2>Git-walkthrough-add</h2>

    <p> <i>In recent gits, <code>git add -p</code> does exactly what this tool
    does. So I will not be putting a lot of energy into maintaining this any
    more.</i> </p>

    <p> Git-wt-add is a darcs-style interactive staging script for git. It
    walks you through unstaged changes on a hunk-by-hunk basis and allows you
    to pick the ones you'd like staged. It features colorized diff output and a
    full set of navigation and dispatch commands.  </p>

    <p> You can download the script <a href="git-wt-add">here</a>. <p>

    <p> Git-wt-add is based on <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/41033">git-hunk-commit</a>
    --darcs, which was very close to what I wanted, but wasn't quite it. In
    general git-wt-add makes no attempt to conform to the real darcs interface,
    but it's probably pretty close. </p>
